# Project Horus's MFSK Binary Telemetry System (DEPRECATED)


**This repository is being transitioned across to [horusdemodlib](https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib). The decoders in this repository will remain compatible with the decoders in horusdemodlib, at least for the Horus Binary v1 mode. The Payload ID Lists within this repository will no longer be updated as of July 2020.**

**Please visit [horusdemodlib](https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib) for future updates, and information on decoding telemetry from Project Horus's (and other) high-altitude balloon launches.**
